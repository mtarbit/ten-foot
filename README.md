Ten Foot
========

Another run at the TV app problem I was experimenting with in the 
[10ft](http://github.com/mtarbit/10ft/) repo, only this time as an 
old-fashioned rails app. None of that new-fangled node nonsense.

Also it's HTML5 video for now, rather than VLC, which means it can 
only play a limited subset of video formats and might need to queue
things for conversion and what-not. Bleh.
