Ten Foot
========

Another run at the TV app problem I was experimenting with in the 
[10ft](http://github.com/mtarbit/10ft/) repo, only this time as an 
old-fashioned rails app. None of that new-fangled node nonsense.

It uses an HTML5 video player were possible, and the VLC browser
plugin for formats that aren't supported. I haven't found a way to
get that plugin running on OS X (though it should in theory) so
this is Linux only for now.

See the [installation instructions](https://raw.github.com/mtarbit/ten-foot/master/doc/INSTALL.txt)
for more details. Though be forewarned that it's a fairly involved
process for now and probably not for the faint of heart.
